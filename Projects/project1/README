Approach

- Depending on the input split functionaliy into SSL or nonSSL mode
- In case of NON SSL mode, open a socket with the given host and port and 
  then proceed to send a HELLO Message. Once the Hello Message is responded
  with a STATUS message start solving equations until BYE is received
  and print secret_flag

- In the case of an SSL use the Publickeystore created before hand to
  send requests.
  To create the public keystore 
    - Receive the Server's public key into a .cert file
    - Generate a Self signed Certificate into a private keystore
    - Use this store to extract a public keystore
    - Embed the Server's public key  into the public keystore (which should
      now contain the both server's and the client's public keys)


  Use this keystore to help get create an SSL socket
- Once socekt is created establish handshake
- After handshake , same set of functionality as NON SSL Mode

- Throughout , server response is constanly checked for corruptness

- Testing was done by trying out different input parameters and using different
  combinations .
